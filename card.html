			<p class="description section-layout">The gray wolf (Canis lupus), is a large canine native to Eurasia and
				North America.
				More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, and gray wolves,
				as colloquially understood, comprise non-domestic/feral subspecies.
				It is also distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and
				muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail.</p>
